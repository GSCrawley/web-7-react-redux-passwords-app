# Local Storage

Local Storage is a browser feature that allows apps to store data 
locally. What does that mean? 

Local storage works in the browser. Data is stored with the browser. 
That means opening an app in Safari stores data with Safari. Opening
the same web site with Chrome the data would not be available! 

Loading the same web site on a different computer, for example your 
desktop at home vs your lap top, or you phone. Each device has it's 
own local storage and stores data independantly of the other devices. 

Hmmm, what's this good for? Think of data stored in local storage 
like a file saved to the device. It's not like data stored to the 
cloud.
